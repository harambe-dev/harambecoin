HarambeCoin (HMBC)
==================
A commemorative digital currency to honor the memory of Harambe. 
He was an outstanding monkey. 
More details to come soon.


Updates:
--------
- Source code updated to litecoin v0.8.x branch
- Maturity currently set at 12 blocks, needs to be 120 (min) for real network
- 1 billion coins max
- uses boilerplate diff retarget and block rewards -> this needs major updates
- DNS Seeds set to null; need to set up nodes for actual network
- No genesis block created in this update for either network
- Fix leveldb permissions so daemon compiles correctly on unix
- Quick fix for client version so wallet doesn't incorrectly attempt downgrade
- Moved 'To Do' to a seperate file
- Windows Test Client compiled and running correctly

> Once the next major update is complete, this readme will become more generic
> and updates can be moved in to a release log of some fashion
